# Adding-factorials
The app will count sum of factorials of digits of number you have entered
So let me explain - It was an app I had to create for a class but I liked that and decided to create a repository out of it 
since I don't have anything in here
Nothing special but it took me a while to understand how to;
1) count factorial of number
2) count the sum of digits of any number
3) join the two above together

Hope you it helps you somehow!

EDIT: If you only want to count the factorial just change the used function in code from "addingFactorial" to "factorial"
